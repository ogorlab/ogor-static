<mark>It is a useful and easy-to-use application that helps you get an overview of the health status of crops.</mark> The fact that you can also add notes to parcels or manually measure portions of parcels are nice bonuses. It saves me time by directing me straight to where I see problems in the application. Additionally, the customer service should not be overlooked as it is impeccable.
